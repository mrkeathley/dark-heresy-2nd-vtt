# Dark Heresy 2nd Edition

This is an _unofficial_ system for playing Dark Heresy 2nd Edition on [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

This system is intended to provide extensive support for character sheets, compendium packs, and automated management. The existing system listed on Foundry was character sheet only and thus this system was created to facilitate the automation features I desired.

## Install
 - Go to the setup page and choose _Game Systems_.
 - Click the _Install System_ button, and paste in this [manifest link](https://s3-keathley.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dark-heresy-2nd/system.json)
 - Create a Game World using the "Dark Heresy 2nd Edition" system.

### Thanks
- I liked the layout of the WH4e sheet on Roll20 and tried to mimic that where possible. Thanks to the authors for that inspiration.
- I studied the original DH2e Foundry VTT project by moo-man. I ended up not using much from there but learned a lot about Foundry. I appreciate the head start!
- My tabletop group for play testing and feedback.
